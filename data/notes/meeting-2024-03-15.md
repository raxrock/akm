- Alex Johnson (Backend Lead)
- Michael Wang (Frontend Lead)
- Maria Garcia (Backend)
- John Smith (Platform)
- Emily Brown (Platform)
- David Lee (Backend)

## Agenda

### 1. Sprint Review

**Completed Items:**
- User Service: OAuth 2.0 integration completed by Maria Garcia
- Order Service: MongoDB migration finished by Alex Johnson
- API Gateway: Rate limiting implemented by John Smith

**In Progress:**
- Inventory Service: Real-time stock sync with WMS (David Lee)
- Frontend: New checkout flow (Michael Wang)

**Blocked:**
- Notification Service: Waiting for AWS SES approval

### 2. Architecture Discussion

Sarah Chen presented the proposal for implementing event sourcing in the Order Service. Key points:

- Current state: Direct database updates with no audit trail
- Proposed: Event sourcing with Apache Kafka
- Benefits: Full audit trail, easier debugging, replay capability
- Concerns: Increased complexity, learning curve

Decision: Proof of concept to be developed by Alex Johnson in Q2.

### 3. Security Review Follow-up

Jennifer Walsh (CSO) shared findings from last week's security audit:

- **Critical**: API keys exposed in frontend bundle
  - Assigned to: Michael Wang
  - Due: March 20, 2024

- **High**: Missing rate limiting on auth endpoints
  - Assigned to: John Smith
  - Status: Completed

- **Medium**: Outdated dependencies in User Service
  - Assigned to: Maria Garcia
  - Due: March 22, 2024

### 4. Performance Issues

David Lee reported slow response times in Inventory Service during peak hours:

- Current P99 latency: 2.5 seconds
- Target: 500ms
- Root cause: N+1 queries to MySQL
- Solution: Implement query batching and Redis caching

Alex Johnson suggested using read replicas for the MySQL database.

### 5. Upcoming Releases

| Service | Version | Release Date | Owner |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------|
| User Service | 2.1.0 | March 20 | Maria Garcia |
| Order Service | 1.5.0 | March 25 | Alex Johnson |
| API Gateway | 3.0.0 | April 1 | John Smith |

### 6. Action Items
