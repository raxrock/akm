## Agenda

### 1. Action Items Review

| Item | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|--------|

### 2. Incident Post-Mortem: March 18 Outage

**Summary:** 45-minute outage affecting Order Service

**Timeline:**
- 14:23: Alerts triggered for high error rate
- 14:28: On-call engineer (Alex Johnson) paged
- 14:35: Root cause identified - MongoDB connection pool exhausted
- 14:52: Fix deployed - increased pool size
- 15:08: Service fully recovered

**Root Cause:**
The Order Service was creating new MongoDB connections for each request instead of using the connection pool. This was introduced in commit `abc123` by a contractor.

**Action Items:**
1. [ ] Alex Johnson: Add connection pool monitoring
2. [ ] Sarah Chen: Update code review checklist
3. [ ] Maria Garcia: Create integration test for connection handling

### 3. Q2 Planning Preview

Sarah Chen shared the preliminary Q2 roadmap:

**Platform Team:**
- Kubernetes migration (John Smith)
- Observability improvements - OpenTelemetry (Emily Brown)
- CI/CD pipeline optimization

**Backend Team:**
- Event sourcing implementation (Alex Johnson)
- GraphQL API layer (Maria Garcia)
- Performance optimization sprint (David Lee)

**Frontend Team:**
- Mobile app v2.0 (Michael Wang)
- Design system update (Lisa Anderson)
- Accessibility audit remediation

### 4. Technical Debt Discussion

David Lee raised concerns about growing technical debt:

**High Priority:**
1. User Service: Legacy authentication code (Maria Garcia)
2. Order Service: Missing unit tests - 40% coverage (Alex Johnson)
3. API Gateway: Outdated Kong version (John Smith)

**Decision:** Allocate 20% of Q2 sprint capacity to tech debt reduction.
